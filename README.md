# Hall Effect Experiement
 Determining the energy band gap of undoped Indium Antimonide at room temperatures using Hall Effect principles.

 The python scripts in this repository were used to aid the data analysis process for the experiment. There are example data files included so that the programmes can be run.

All the example data files originate from data collected during the lab experiment in 2022 by myself and my lab partner, Eleanor Pearson.
